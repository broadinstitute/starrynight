"""Test for the StarryNight getting-started workflow steps.

This test module verifies the core functionality of the StarryNight getting-started
workflow, focusing on a modular testing approach that can be extended incrementally.

Current scope:
- Experiment configuration initialization and editing
- Inventory file generation (mock implementation)

Future extensions:
- Index generation from inventory (parsing file paths)
- Experiment file creation from index and configuration
- LoadData CSV generation for illumination correction
- CellProfiler pipeline generation
- Illumination correction execution

Testing strategy:
This module uses a fixture-based approach with controlled file operations
instead of executing actual CLI commands. This strategy:
1. Avoids dependency issues (e.g., CellProfiler dependencies)
2. Increases test reliability and speed
3. Focuses on validating the file structure and content rather than implementation details
4. Allows tests to be extended incrementally as the workflow grows

Each workflow step is tested in isolation with appropriate assertions to
verify the correctness of outputs. The test uses the FIX-S1 input and workspace
fixtures for consistent and reusable test data.

def test_experiment_init_and_inventory(fix_s1_input_dir, fix_s1_workspace):
    """Test the experiment initialization and inventory generation steps.

    This test focuses on the first two steps of the workflow from getting-started.md:
    1. Initialize experiment configuration and edit with required channel values
    2. Generate inventory from input data

    This is the first part of a modular testing approach for the complete workflow.
    Future tests will extend this to cover index generation, experiment file creation,
    and LoadData file generation for illumination correction.

    Instead of executing actual CLI commands, this test:
    - Directly creates and validates the experiment_init.json file
    - Simulates the inventory generation by creating the expected output structure

    This approach avoids dependencies on external tools like CellProfiler while still
    verifying the correct file structure and content expected by subsequent workflow steps.

    # === Roadmap for Future Test Extensions ===
    # The following steps would complete the getting-started.md workflow:
    #
    # Step 4: Generate index
    # - Generate mock index.parquet in the ${WKDIR}/index/ directory
    # - Simulate "starrynight index gen -i ${WKDIR}/inventory/inventory.parquet -o ${WKDIR}/index/"
    #
    # Step 5: Create experiment file
    # - Generate experiment.json using the experiment_init.json template
    # - Simulate "starrynight exp new -i ${WKDIR}/index/index.parquet -e "Pooled CellPainting [Generic]"
    #   -c ${WKDIR}/experiment_init.json -o ${WKDIR}"
    #
    # Step 6: Generate LoadData files for illumination correction
    # - Generate LoadData CSV files in the appropriate directory
    # - Simulate "starrynight illum calc loaddata -i ${WKDIR}/index/index.parquet
    #   -o ${WKDIR}/cellprofiler/loaddata/cp/illum/illum_calc --exp_config ${WKDIR}/experiment.json --use_legacy"
    #
    # Step 7: Verify the final workflow state
    # - LoadData files exist and contain expected content
    # - All file paths are correctly configured
