# Test Fixtures

This directory contains files used by test fixtures for the StarryNight project.

## Directory Structure

- `basic_setup/`: Pre-generated files for quickly running LoadData tests
  - `experiment.json`: Experiment configuration file (result of steps 1-5 in getting-started workflow)
  - `index.parquet`: Generated index file (result of steps 1-5 in getting-started workflow)
- `stitch_images/`: Image files for testing the stitching functionality
  - Various `.tif` files for testing image stitching operations
  - `tile_config.*.txt`: Configuration files for stitching
- `test.cppipe`: Sample CellProfiler pipeline for testing

## Usage

### basic_setup/

The files in `basic_setup/` are used by the `fix_starrynight_pregenerated_setup` fixture defined in `starrynight/tests/conftest.py`. This fixture provides pre-generated files that would normally be created by steps 1-5 of the getting-started workflow, allowing faster test execution when you're only testing LoadData generation.

These files were generated by running the first 5 steps of the getting-started workflow and capturing the resulting files:
1. Initialize experiment configuration
2. Edit configuration with required channel values
3. Generate inventory from input data
4. Generate index from inventory
5. Create experiment file from index and configuration

### stitch_images/

The images in `stitch_images/` are used for testing image stitching functionality. These are small sample images that can be used to verify that the stitching algorithms work correctly.

### test.cppipe

A sample CellProfiler pipeline file used for testing pipeline parsing and processing.

## Adding New Fixtures

When adding new fixtures:

1. Create a descriptive subdirectory if the fixtures form a logical group
2. Update this README.md with information about the new fixtures
3. Document how the fixtures were generated and their purpose
4. Prefer small, focused test fixtures over large ones
5. For binary files, include information about their origin and purpose
