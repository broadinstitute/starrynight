# Starry Night Documentation Review Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines a focused approach for reviewing the restructured Starry Night architecture documentation, concentrating on critical aspects without over-engineering the process.

## Key Review Areas

### 1. Terminology Consistency
- Focus on core architectural terms across documents
- Ensure consistent usage of:
  - Framework components (Starry Night, Pipecraft, Bilayers)
  - Key architectural concepts (modules, pipelines, execution)
- Note any significant inconsistencies for correction

### 2. Navigation Verification
- Verify "Next" links at the end of documents
- Check critical cross-references between layers
- Ensure the logical progression flows naturally

### 3. Technical Spot-Checking
- Sample code examples against actual implementation
- Check a selection of architectural descriptions against codebase
- Focus on most critical interfaces and concepts only

### 4. Core Concept Reinforcement
- Verify consistent explanation of key architectural principles:
  - Algorithm independence
  - Module dual focus (spec + compute graph)
  - Backend-agnostic execution
  - Automatic workflow generation

## Pragmatic Implementation

The review will:
1. Maintain a light touch where documentation is already strong
2. Focus on high-impact improvements
3. Prioritize critical architectural concepts over minor details
4. Check for major gaps rather than exhaustive completeness

This approach recognizes that the documentation is already well-structured, focusing only on the elements that most impact user understanding of the Starry Night architecture.
