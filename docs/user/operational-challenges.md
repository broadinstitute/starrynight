# StarryNight Operational Challenges FAQ

## Introduction

This FAQ addresses critical operational challenges faced by research teams transitioning from PCPIP to StarryNight for high-throughput microscopy image processing. These questions emerged from real-world discussions with users processing Cell Painting and Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS) data at scale.

StarryNight's modular architecture provides robust solutions for most scenarios. However, as one developer noted: *"Most of these use cases are very edge use cases, and this should mean that [the] biologist who is processing [data] is fairly competent and knows about the system."* While user-friendly interfaces for every edge case would require substantial development effort, the core capabilities exist and are accessible to advanced users.

**Key Insight**: StarryNight's strength lies in its flexible, index-driven approach rather than rigid workflows. Most operational challenges stem from biological data complexity, not architectural limitations.

**Status Legend:**
- ‚úÖ **Available**: Ready to use with current system
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Workaround**: Possible but requires manual coordination
- üöß **Planned**: Architecturally supported, needs implementation
- üî¨ **Design**: Requires significant architectural consideration

## 1. Starting Processing Before All Images Are Available

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes we want to start before all the images are available (because image generation can take up to a couple of weeks on the SBS arm, so we want to do processing of the phenotyping arm while the barcoding is not started or only partially done)."*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Currently Available**

**Technical Solution**:
StarryNight's modular pipeline architecture supports this through composition and registry customization:

**Code Location**: `/starrynight/src/starrynight/pipelines/pcp_generic.py`

Current implementation shows parallel CP and SBS processing:
```python
# Existing combined pipeline structure
Parallel([
    Seq([cp_illum_calc_loaddata.pipe, cp_illum_calc_cpipe.pipe, ...]),  # CP pipeline
    Seq([sbs_illum_calc_loaddata.pipe, sbs_illum_calc_cpipe.pipe, ...])  # SBS pipeline
])
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Create Pipeline Variants**: Copy `pcp_generic.py` to create specialized versions (requires developer)
2. **Register New Pipelines**: Add to `PIPELINE_REGISTRY` in `/starrynight/src/starrynight/pipelines/registry.py`
3. **Execute Separately**:
   ```bash
   # Current: Create full experiment
   starrynight exp new -i index.parquet -e "Pooled CellPainting [Generic]" -c config.json -o output/

   # Proposed: Separate pipelines (would need implementation)
   starrynight exp new -e "Pooled CellPainting [Phenotypic]" -c cp_config.json -o cp_output/
   starrynight exp new -e "Pooled CellPainting [SBS]" -c sbs_config.json -o sbs_output/
   ```

**Current Reality**: Must modify codebase to add new pipeline types. The modular architecture supports this, but requires development effort rather than configuration.

**Alternative Approach**: Use existing pipeline but filter processing to skip unavailable data (discussed by developers as viable workaround).

## 2. Adding Cycles Mid-Experiment

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes they decide to add a cycle partway through because one cycle got screwed up, so the cycle counts we put in at the beginning are now wrong."*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Currently Available** (with data loss)

**Technical Advantage**: StarryNight auto-detects cycles from data structure, not configuration.

**Code Evidence**: In `/starrynight/src/starrynight/experiments/pcp_generic.py`:
```python
# Auto-detects number of cycles from actual data
sbs_n_cycles = (
    sbs_images_df.select(pl.col("cycle_id").unique().count())
    .collect()
    .rows()[0][0]
)
```

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Add New Cycle Images**: Place additional cycle data in the dataset
2. **Re-inventory**: `starrynight inventory` (detects new files)
3. **Re-index**: `starrynight index` (updates cycle count automatically)
4. **Reconfigure**: `starrynight exp new` (creates new experiment with updated cycle count)
5. **Reprocess**: All downstream processing adapts to detected cycles automatically

**Trade-off**: Previous processing results are lost and must be recomputed. No incremental update capability currently exists.

**Advanced Note**: If you need to *exclude* specific cycles (e.g., skip corrupted cycle 5), this must be handled in the CellProfiler pipeline configuration, not in StarryNight's index layer.

## 3. Resource Management and Retry Logic

### 3A. Failed Job Retry on Larger Machines

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes tasks fail and need to be retried on a larger machine"*

**Status**: üöß **Planned Architecture** (6-12 months)

**Current Reality**: Basic retry exists through Snakemake backend (`/pipecraft/src/pipecraft/backend/snakemake.py`), but no resource escalation.

**Planned Solution - Resource Hints System**:
The architecture supports this through a planned resource hints API:

```python
# Conceptual module configuration
module_config = {
    "cpu_cores": 4,
    "memory_gb": 16,
    "retry_with_larger": True  # Escalate resources on failure
}
```

**Technical Flow**: StarryNight modules ‚Üí PipeCraft compilation ‚Üí Backend execution (Snakemake/AWS Batch)

**Current Workaround**: Manual job resubmission with modified resource configurations.

### 3B. Rerunning Successful Jobs with New Pipeline Versions

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes I want to do that on a subset of all jobs which previously succeeded"*

**Status**: ‚öôÔ∏è **Manual Workaround Available**

**Current Capability**: Can rerun individual modules or entire workflows through Conductor backend, but no bulk selection interface.

**Technical Reality**: As the developer noted: *"This was not part of the design, so I haven't thought about this when I was designing the whole thing. So I don't know right now... what challenges are there."*

**Manual Approach**: Force rerun of specific modules through Canvas UI or rebuild entire pipeline with new parameters.

## 4. Handling Corrupted Images

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes an image is corrupted and needs to be dropped from the experiment (and/or replaced with a dummy image)"*

**Status**: üöß **Architectural Design Phase** (6-12 months)

**Technical Challenge**: Index files use Parquet format, which is immutable by design.

**Code Context**: Index structure in `/starrynight/src/starrynight/algorithms/index.py`

**Proposed Solution - Filter-Based Approach**:
Rather than modifying index files, create filtering layers:

1. **Blacklist Creation**: Generate separate index files identifying corrupted images
2. **Anti-join Processing**: Filter main index during data loading:
   ```python
   # Conceptual filtering approach using polars
   filtered_df = main_index_df.join(blacklist_df, on="file_path", how="anti")
   ```
3. **Marimo Interface**: Interactive notebook for filter creation and management
4. **Workflow Integration**: All downstream modules respect filtered indices

**Implementation Gap**: No current CLI commands for index manipulation. Would need new filtering utilities in `/starrynight/src/starrynight/utils/dfutils.py`.

**Current Workaround**: Manual file deletion and complete re-indexing (requires careful coordination).

---

## 5. Different Pipeline Versions Per Plate

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes some plates need a different version of the pipeline than other plates (within the same experiment) - which we won't know ahead of time"*

**Status**: ‚öôÔ∏è **Currently Available** (via multiple projects)

**Technical Approach**: Index filtering + separate project management

**Code Capability**: `/starrynight/src/starrynight/utils/dfutils.py` provides filtering:
```python
def filter_df_by_column_val(df: pl.LazyFrame, column: str, val: str) -> pl.LazyFrame:
    filtered_df = df.filter(pl.col(column).eq(val))
    return filtered_df
```

**Implementation Workflow**:
As the developer explained: *"It's gonna be a two step process... in the cyanide UI, you create a new project... when it comes to indexing, filter everything out but plate one... And then create a new project, do the same things, but in the indexing step, filter out... plate one, but keep everything else."*

1. **Canvas UI**: Create separate projects for each plate
2. **Index Filtering**: During project setup, filter to include only target plate
3. **Pipeline Assignment**: Configure different pipeline versions per project
4. **Coordinate Results**: Manually manage multiple project outputs

**Developer Note**: *"It's doable. It's not pretty, but I guess... that's how they do it... even like in the separate runs for this thing."*

**User Requirements**: Understanding of project management and index filtering concepts.

**Limitation**: Not elegant - requires multiple project coordination. No single-project, multi-pipeline capability exists.

---

## 6. Different Pipeline Versions Per Well

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes a single well needs a different version of the pipeline than other wells (within the same experiment)"*

**Status**: ‚öôÔ∏è **Technically Possible** (extreme edge case)

**Solution**: Same approach as plate-level filtering but at well granularity through Canvas project creation with index filtering.

**Practical Reality**: As one participant noted, this is *"a very weird edge case situation"* requiring substantial manual coordination. While technically possible through the filtering system, it's not streamlined for regular use.

**User Requirements**: Advanced workflow management skills and deep understanding of granular data selection.

**Assessment**: Functional but not elegant. Represents the boundary of practical workflow complexity.

## 7. Machine Failures During Job Launch

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes whatever machine is being used to launch the jobs locks up or dies."*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Built-in Architecture Strength**

**Technical Solution**: Cloud-native design provides automatic resilience

**Technical Explanation**: As the developer explained: *"The way things are written right now, it assumes that it's reading and writing from s3... automatically, in that sense, you don't really lose any state because... you're not using your local storage."*

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **S3 Storage Backend**: All state persisted to cloud storage
- **Stateless Job Design**: Jobs can be relaunched on any machine
- **AWS Batch Recovery**: Automatic instance failure detection and reallocation
- **No EFS Required**: S3-based approach more robust than EFS-backed alternatives

**User Experience**: Transparent recovery - handled automatically at infrastructure level.

## 8. Incorrect Channel Mapping Information

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes the biologist shared incorrect information about what was in each channel and our original mapping is wrong"*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Currently Available** with built-in validation

**Technical Reality**: StarryNight already provides syntactic validation

**Code Evidence**: In `pcp_generic.py`:
```python
# Existing channel validation
for cp_custom_channel in init_config_parsed.cp_custom_channel_map.keys():
    assert cp_custom_channel in cp_channel_list
```

**Validation Capabilities**:
- **Syntactic**: Ensures channel names exist in indexed data
- **Error Prevention**: Clear error messages for non-existent channels
- **Configuration Update**: Modify mappings through Project Settings or experiment config

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Update Channel Mapping**: Modify experiment configuration with correct channel assignments
2. **Validate Configuration**: Built-in checks verify channel names against index
3. **Reconfigure Project**: Apply new mapping to all modules
4. **Full Rerun**: Execute complete pipeline with corrected mapping

**Limitation**: Only syntactic validation exists. Semantic validation (e.g., detecting swapped biological meanings) requires manual verification.

**User Interface**: Available through Canvas Project Settings at `/canvas/app/dashboard/project/id/[id]/view/project-settings/`

---

## 9. Incorrect Non-Channel Parameters

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes the biologist shared incorrect information about some other parameter that doesn't affect channel mapping (like we need to adjust the stitchcrop hyperparameters to be for round vs square; or we need to update the path to the barcodes because the first ones were bad)"*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Fully Supported**

**Technical Implementation**: Parameter updates through UI and configuration management

**UI Access**: Canvas project settings interface at `/canvas/app/dashboard/project/id/[id]/view/project-settings/`

**Common Parameter Categories**:
- **Stitchcrop hyperparameters**: Round vs. square acquisition settings
- **Barcode CSV locations**: Update path to correct barcode files
- **Analysis thresholds**: CellProfiler module parameters
- **Output configurations**: Result storage and naming

**Update Process**:
1. **Navigate to Project Settings**: Use web interface for parameter modification
2. **Update Relevant Parameters**: Modify specific configuration values
3. **Save and Reconfigure**: Apply changes to affected modules
4. **Selective Rerun**: Execute only modules affected by parameter changes

**Alternative Access**: Parameters can also be modified in Marimo execution notebooks for advanced users.

**User Requirements**: Understanding of parameter impacts on different pipeline stages and module dependencies.

---

## 10. Mixed Round and Square Acquisition

**Real-World Scenario**: *"Sometimes the biologist uses both round acquisition (e.g. for phenotyping) and square acquisition (e.g. for SBS)"*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Built-in Support**

**Technical Implementation**: Independent configuration for CP and SBS acquisition types

**Code Evidence**: In `/starrynight/src/starrynight/experiments/pcp_generic.py`:
```python
class CPConfig(BaseModel):
    img_frame_type: ImageFrameType = Field(ImageFrameType.ROUND)
    acquisition_order: AcquisitionOrderType = Field(AcquisitionOrderType.SNAKE)

class SBSConfig(BaseModel):
    img_frame_type: ImageFrameType = Field(ImageFrameType.ROUND)
    acquisition_order: AcquisitionOrderType = Field(AcquisitionOrderType.SNAKE)
```

**Configuration Options**:
- **Cell Painting Config**: Independent image frame type (`ROUND`/`SQUARE`) and acquisition order
- **SBS Config**: Separate image frame type and acquisition pattern settings
- **Module Support**: Stitchcrop module automatically handles different acquisition types

**Usage Examples**:
- Phenotypic arm: `ImageFrameType.ROUND` with `AcquisitionOrderType.SNAKE`
- SBS arm: `ImageFrameType.SQUARE` with `AcquisitionOrderType.SNAKE`

**User Interface**: Settings configurable through standard experiment setup process.

**User Requirements**: Understanding of acquisition type implications for downstream image processing.
