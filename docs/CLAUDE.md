This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with documentation in this repository.

# StarryNight Documentation Guidelines

## Structure Principles
- Follow progressive disclosure (overview → concepts → details)
- Use clear section headers and consistent header levels
- Keep directory structure shallow (2-3 levels max)
- Ensure each section has a clear entry point document

## Content Standards
- Use consistent Markdown formatting with appropriate language tags
- Write concisely with numbered steps for complex procedures
- Include concrete examples with real commands and outputs
- Format code blocks, file paths, and commands appropriately
- Link to existing docs rather than duplicating content
